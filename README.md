##PointSift
An implementation of PointSift using Pytorch (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00652.pdf) lies in the PoinSift folder.
The C_utils folder contains some algorithms inplemented in CUDA and C++ taken from the original implementation of PointSift (https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/pointSIFT) but wrapped to be used with Pytorch Tensor directly.
